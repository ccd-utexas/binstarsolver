# binstarsolver

Estimate physical quantities of a binary star system from observable quantities.

This model is a simple spherical detached binary star model with no limb darkening. Methods are from equations in chapter 7 of [1]_ and chapter 7 of [2]_.

## Examples

### Observable quantities

* Times of begin/end ingress/egress and mid-eclipse.
* Orbital period.
* Light levels during occultation (primary eclipse), transit (secondary eclipse), outside of eclipse.
* 

### Estimated physical quantities

*
